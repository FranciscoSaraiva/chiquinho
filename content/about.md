I'm a software developer from Portugal ðŸ‡µðŸ‡¹. I'm passionate about web development and I love to learn new things, mainly frameworks and languages.

In a project I always strive to maintain a firm overview, and offer assistance to the best of my capabilities. I find getting to know and sympathize with the team is important to an efficient work ethic and atmosphere.

Behind group unity lies the key to success.
