### Projects

#### [Sparkmate [Discontinued]](https://github.com/FranciscoSaraiva/Sparkmate)

**Sparkmate** was a chrome extension to be used with [Granblue Fantasy](https://granbluefantasy.jp/en/). It was created as a joke among my crew *(and just me wanting to know how browser extesions were made)* as a way to prevent players from spending paid resources in the game. It has been discontinued after the V2 manifest deprecated the use of the extension, and lack of interest of me from playing the game.

#### [Simple Chat Socket](https://github.com/FranciscoSaraiva/challenger-chat)

**Simple Chat Socket** is a simple chat application that uses websockets to communicate between clients and the server. It was created as a tool for job applicants to use while interviewing at OLX.

#### [GestaoCondominios](https://github.com/andreRcoutinho/gestao-condominios)

**GestaoCondominios** is a tool for managing condominiums. It was created as a project while studying at University of Minho.

#### Shrews AR

**Shrews** is a 3D puzzle game for smartphones that uses Augmented Reality to teach Computational Thinking concepts. It was my master's dissertation project.
